Leverage Proven Code

Do not re-implement solved problems.

Prefer small, well-maintained libraries over custom code.

Write code only where it creates domain-specific value.

Treat dependencies as part of the design: read their source, know their limits.

Avoid wrapping libraries unless it removes real complexity.

If a library is heavier than the problem, reject it and state why.

Heuristic:
If a correct, battle-tested package exists, using it is simpler than rolling your own.
